# Osu beatmap downloader

## About

* This is a command line tool designed to help osu! players download beatmaps which they have played, base on minimum playcount prompted by user
* I created this tool since I've reset Window and have forgot creating backup for old beatmaps. 

## Download

You can download this applicaion <a herf="https://github.com/kusanali3110/Osu-BeatmapDownloader/releases/tag/v.1.0">here</a> or just simply clone this repo.

## How to use

1. To begin with, you need to create a <a herf="https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit#oauth">OAuth Application</a> on your Osu! account. Click on "New OAuth applicaion", give it a name and "Register application", you will recieve CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET. 
2. Launch "BeatmapDownloader.exe". At the first launch, the tool will ask you to provide CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET. Use information you got in the first step.
3. After that, a file called "config.ini" will be created at the same directory, containing provided information. You can change those information at any time you want.

## Note
* The .exe file is only compatible with Window OS.
